QTerm 0.2.0 Release
===================

This version contains various improvements and bug fixes. Hopefully,
you would have a different experience.

And we have updated the FAQ at http://qterm.gnuchina.org/faq.html,
check before you report a bug.

We encourage you to upgrade, because QTerm 0.1.x will _not_ receive 
maintenance any more. 

Thanks for those report bugs and give suggestions.
