QTerm Readme
============

QTerm is a BBS client for X Window System.  Our goal is to make a client 

similar to Sterm and CTerm in MS Windows.

QTerm is mainly based on miniterm from GNU China.  Thanks to smartfish

and kafa; thanks to Open Source.

QTerm is released under GNU GPL (refer to COPYING).  It can be modified 

and distributed freely.

Thanks to many users for their bug reports and suggestions.

Good Luck!
