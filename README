QTerm Readme
==================

QTerm is a BBS client for X Window System.  Our goal is to make a client 

similiar to STerm and CTerm in MS Windows.

QTerm mainly based on gnuchina miniterm.  Thanks to smartfish and kafa;

thanks to Open Source.

QTerm is released under GNU GPL( refer to COPYING ). It  can be modified 

and distributed freely.

Thanks to many users for bug report and suggestion.

Good Luck!
